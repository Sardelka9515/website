    Open the program. You should see a semi-transparent button floating on your screen. 
    By default, it's located on the right of your screen. 
    Clicking on it will expand the menu, which provides some useful functions for you. 
    The icon should be easy  enough to understand. No further explanations needed.

    You can change SurfaceHome's settings by right-clicking on the icon. This will open a options window.

    <br /><div class="Snapshot"><img class="Snapshot_img" src="/imgs/misc/SH_Options.png" /></div>
    <br />
    Here, you can adjust the button's size, opacity, onclick action, and so on.
