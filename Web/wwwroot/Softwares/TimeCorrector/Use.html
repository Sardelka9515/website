Run the program as administrator.<br />
The first TextBox lets you set your ntp time server to sync. Leave it unchanged normally.<br />
The second TextBox lets you customize the sync interval. Only a floating-point numeric value is allowed.<br />
If you started the automatic sync procedure, you will see a TextBlock at the buttom showing the last sync result. Normally it should be "Succeeded".<br />
There are two buttons on the buttom of the window:<br />
Click "Start" to correct your system time immediately and the program will correct it again after the specified period of time.<br/>
Click "Sync Now" to correct your system time at once. The automatic sync procedure won't be started.
